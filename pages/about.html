        <h1>About Me</h1><br>
    <p>"Hey there! I'm Rahul Duhan, an agriculture student with a love for technology and
        open source software. I'm always trying to learn new things and improve my skills in web design, computer languages and other areas of technology. I'm a huge fan of Linux and Android and love to customize them to my liking.<br><br>
        I'm not just into agriculture for the field work, but also exploring new ways to improve the industry with the help of technology. I believe that by combining my love for technology and agriculture, I can find new ways to improve the industry and make a real impact. I'm excited to share my journey with you as I explore the intersection of technology and agriculture and see what kind of cool stuff I can come up with.<br><br>
        When I'm not in front of my computer, you can find me drawing cartoons or listening to J-pop all the time, it's my favorite music. Drawing cartoons is my way of expressing my creativity and it helps me to come up with new ideas and solutions.<br><br>
        So join me on this journey, let's see what we can achieve together and make a real impact in the world."
